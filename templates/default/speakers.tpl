					<td><p>Troy Dawson is currently a senior software engineer working in the operations section of the Red Hat OpenShift project.  Prior to working for Red Hat, Troy worked for Fermilab for 18 years where he was one of two lead developers of Scientific Linux and Fermi Linux.</p></td>
					<td><h5>OpenShift: letting developers
develop</h5><p>OpenShift is a way for web developers that use Free and Open Source
languages, develop and test their web apps.  They don't have to worry
about the hosting, the compiling or all the other headaches that come
with building an app on the web.  Red Hat and the OpenShift team takes
care of the messy part, then the developer can concentrate on developing.</p></td>

					<td><img src="{#ROOT#}/images/speakers/hugs-headshot.jpg" class="small" alt="" /></a><span class="caption">Jason Huggins</span></td>
					<td><p>Jason Huggins co-founded Sauce Labs and currently leads product
					direction. Prior to Sauce Labs, Jason was a Test Engineer at Google
					where he supported the grid-scale "Selenium Farm" for testing Google
					applications such as Gmail and Google Docs. Jason's experience also
					includes time at ThoughtWorks in Chicago as a software developer.
					While at ThoughtWorks, Jason created the Selenium testing framework
					out of the need to cross-browser test a new in-house time and expense
					system. </p>

					<p>When not programming in Python or JavaScript, Jason enjoys hacking on
					Arduino-based electronics projects. Jason has spent time in New York
					City, LA, and the Bay Area, but Chicago is his kind of town.</p></td>
					<td><h5>Extreme Mobile Testing... with Robots!</h5>
					<p>Can your robot play Angry Birds? On an iPhone? Mine can. It's called
					"BitbeamBot." It started as an art project, but it has a much more
					serious practical application: mobile web testing. To trust that your
					mobile app truly works, you need an end-to-end test on the actual
					device. BitbeamBot is an Arduino-powered open source hardware robot
					that can test any application on any mobile device.
					</p>
					<p>An end-to-end test on an actual mobile device means the full
					combination of device manufacturer, operating system, data network,
					and application. And since mobile devices were meant to be handled
					with the human hand, you'll also want something like a real hand to do
					real end-to-end testing. After lots of repetitive manual testing, the
					inevitable question is asked "Can we automate the testing of the old
					features, so I can focus the manual testing effort on the new
					features?"
					</p>
					<p>This talk will cover the history of BitbeamBot, how to use it to test
					apps, how it's built, how you can build one yourself.</p>

					<td>
<p>Brian Fitzpatrick started Google's Chicago engineering office in
2005.  An open source contributor for over 13 years, Brian is the
engineering manager for several Google products, a member of both the
Apache Software Foundation and the Open Web Foundation, a former
engineer at Apple and CollabNet, a Subversion developer, a
co-author of "Version Control with Subversion", and a resident of Chicago</p>

					<td><h5>Data Liberation:
The Future of Your Data on the Web</h5>
					<p>As users, we're moving more and more of our data into web-based services and  we need to think more carefully about how we can get that data out of these services, how much control we have over our data, and where our data is going to be in ten or twenty years.  As technologists, we need to think more carefully about how we're treating the data of our users as we're making arbitrary technical decisions that are deeply affecting the future of collaboration and sharing on the web.  In this talk we'll review what my team at Google is doing about this, and what we're thinking about the control of our data in the future.</p>

					<td><img src="{#ROOT#}/images/speakers/BryenYunashko.jpg" class="small" alt="" /></a><span class="caption">Bryen M. Yunashko</span></td>
					<td><p>Bryen Yunashko resides in Chicago and has traveled extensively giving
					talks on accessibility.  He also has the distinction of being the first
					ever DeafBlind person to sit on the board of a major Linux distribution,
					openSUSE.  In his free time, he can be found tinkering with his hobby of
					photography or working with local DeafBlind organizations in the United
					States, where he is also a member of the Illinois Association of the
					DeafBlind.</p></td>
					<td><h5>openSUSE--It's not just a distro!</h5>
					<p>When people see the name "openSUSE" they think of a great distro known
					for its stability and innovation.  But the openSUSE Project is more than
					just a distro, its a community and a philosophy that drives a number of
					open source software projects and partnerships.  Join us as we introduce
					you to the Project and why you benefit from openSUSE even if you don't
					use the distro.</p>

					<td><img src="{#ROOT#}/images/speakers/philgomes.jpg" class="small" alt="" /></a><span class="caption">Phil Gomes</span></td>
					<td><p>By day, Phil Gomes is a Senior Vice President at Edelman, the world's largest public relations firm. He has spoken to global public relations consortia about the intersection of PR and online communities and is well-known as the first PR professional to start a blog. Phil is also a founder of CREWE (Corporate Representative for Ethical Wikipedia Engagement) and helps guide its mission and efforts. 
</p>
					<p>By night, he tries to be a good husband and father, listens to way too much heavy metal, cultivates an appreciation for Brazilian distilled spirits, and reads more libertarian literature than is probably healthy or advisable. Phil has been part of the Flourish family since about 2008 and would have meaningfully volunteered this year if he weren't getting his MBA at Purdue University Calumet. We forgive him. This time.</p>
					</td>
					<td><h5>Corporate Representatives for Ethical Wikipedia Engagement</h5>
					Wikipedia is a well-revered, volunteer-maintained destination for millions of Web users worldwide. Search for almost any topic and a Wikipedia entry is among the first three results. Obviously, a company has a very keen interest in terms of what is said there and, often, are tempted to surreptitiously edit an entry--an indisputably wrong thing to do. However, since some factual data often stays inaccurate for long periods, one might ask what the harm is in a corporate representative correcting, say, the founding date or the annual financials for a company. But even this example oversimplifies the complex relationship between companies (which structured by design) and open platforms like Wikipedia (spontaneously structured). After several false starts, companies and Wikipedians are starting to explore the best ways to work together. This talk will outline the history and efforts to-date.
